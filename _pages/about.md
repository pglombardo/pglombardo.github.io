## Recent Past

I built performance instrumentation for [Instana](https://www.instana.com/) (and previously [Tracelytics](https://twitter.com/tracelytics)) that provides visibility into distributed application stacks.  Visibility consists of key metrics and distributed tracing of requests across processes, hosts, clouds and serverless.

As requests and data are processed in distributed applications, the instrumentation times and traces the execution path of the processing across process and host boundaries.

My focus was on Python and Ruby performance instrumentation although I also did similar work in Go and Node.js.

* Instana [was acquired](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-11-18-IBM-to-Acquire-Instana-as-Company-Continues-to-Advance-its-Hybrid-Cloud-and-AI-Strategy) by IBM on 12/2020.
* Tracelytics [was acquired](https://www.apmdigest.com/appneta-acquires-tracelytics) by AppNeta on 6/2012

## Open Source

I contribute to a large number of open source projects.  See the [Projects](/projects) page or my [Github profile](https://github.com/pglombardo) for more details.
